# PowershellAudioOutputToggler
This powershell script will switch between two pre-defined audio output devices in your computer.
It also automatically generates a shortcut that runs it and can be pinned to your taskbar.
# Setup
1 (Optional). Place the ps1 file in your Desktop or a "Windows shortcut compatible" folder. After step 2, this will allow the generated shortcut to be activated via CTRL+SHIFT+A by default
2. Run the ps1 file once to generate the shortcut. Feel free to pin it to your taskbar.
3 (Optional). If the script is moved, run the script again to automatically update the shortcut, and if pinned, pin it again to update the one in the taskbar.
